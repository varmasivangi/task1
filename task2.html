                <p align="justify">Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, MC (pronounced [bɔjaˈdʒiu]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997),
                    better
                    known as Mother Teresa (Albanian: Nënë Tereza), was an Indian-Albanian Catholic nun who, in 1950,
                    founded
                    the Missionaries of Charity. Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu (pronounced [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]) was born
                    in
                    Skopje—at the time, part of the Ottoman Empire.[a] After eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and
                    then to
                    India, where she lived most of her life. Saint Teresa of Calcutta[b] was canonised on 4 September
                    2016. The
                    anniversary of her death is her feast day.

                    After Mother Teresa founded her religious congregation, it grew to have over 4,500 nuns and was
                    active in
                    133 countries as of 2012.[6] The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS,
                    leprosy,
                    and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's
                    and
                    family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity,
                    poverty,
                    and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of
                    the
                    poor."[7]

                    Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979
                    Nobel
                    Peace Prize. A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired
                    by many
                    for her charitable work. She was praised and criticised on various counts, such as for her views on
                    abortion
                    and contraception, and was criticized for poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her
                    authorized
                    biography was written by Navin Chawla and published in 1992, and she has been the subject of other
                    books as
                    well as films. On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of
                    the
                    Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.</p>

                <h3>Early life</h3>
                <p align="justify">Mother Teresa's given name was Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha)[8][page needed] Bojaxhiu
                    (Albanian:
                    [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]—Anjezë is a cognate of "Agnes"; Gonxhe means "rosebud" or "little flower"
                    in
                    Albanian. She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian family[9][10][11] in Skopje,
                    Ottoman Empire
                    (now the capital of North Macedonia).[12][13] She was baptised in Skopje the day after her birth.[8]
                    She
                    later considered 27 August, the day she was baptised, her "true birthday".[12]

                    She was the youngest child of Nikollë and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai).[14] Her father, who was
                    involved in
                    Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died in 1919 when she was eight years old.[12][c]
                    He was
                    born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), however, his family was from Mirdita (present-day
                    Albania).[15][16] Her
                    mother may have been from a village near Gjakova,[17] believed by her offspring to be
                    Bishtazhin.[18]

                    According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, Anjezë was in her early years when she became
                    fascinated by
                    stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that
                    she
                    should commit herself to religious life.[19] Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as she
                    prayed at the
                    shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimages.[20]

                    Anjezë left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham,
                    Ireland, to
                    learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; English was the language of instruction of
                    the
                    Sisters of Loreto in India.[21] She saw neither her mother nor her sister again.[22] Her family
                    lived in
                    Skopje until 1934, when they moved to Tirana.[23]

                    She arrived in India in 1929[24] and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas,[25]
                    where
                    she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent.[26] She took her first
                    religious
                    vows on 24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of
                    missionaries;[27][28] because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its
                    Spanish
                    spelling of Teresa.[29]

                    Teresa took her solemn vows on 14 May 1937 while she was a teacher at the Loreto convent school in
                    Entally,
                    eastern Calcutta, taking the style of 'Mother' as part of Loreto custom.[12][30][31] She served
                    there for
                    nearly twenty years and was appointed its headmistress in 1944.[32] Although Mother Teresa enjoyed
                    teaching
                    at the school, she was increasingly disturbed by the poverty surrounding her in Calcutta.[33] The
                    Bengal
                    famine of 1943 brought misery and death to the city, and the August 1946 Direct Action Day began a
                    period of
                    Muslim-Hindu violence.[34]

                    In 1946, during a visit to Darjeeling by train, Mother Teresa felt that she heard the call of her
                    inner
                    conscience to serve the poor of India for Jesus. She asked for and received permission to leave the
                    school.
                    In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, choosing a white sari with two blue borders as the
                    order's
                    habit.</p>
                <h3>Missionaries of Charity</h3>
                <p align="justify">On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within
                    the
                    call" when she travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual
                    retreat.
                    "I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail
                    would have
                    been to break the faith."[35] Joseph Langford later wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time,
                    Sister Teresa
                    had just become Mother Teresa".[36]

                    She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,[24] replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a
                    simple,
                    white cotton sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months
                    in
                    Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums.[37][38]
                    She
                    founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and hungry.[39] At the
                    beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women, and she laid
                    the
                    foundation for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor".[40]

                    Her efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including the prime minister.[41]
                    Mother
                    Teresa wrote in her diary that her first year was fraught with difficulty. With no income, she
                    begged for
                    food and supplies and experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to the comfort of
                    convent
                    life during these early months:

                    Our Lord wants me to be a free nun covered with the poverty of the cross. Today, I learned a good
                    lesson.
                    The poverty of the poor must be so hard for them. While looking for a home I walked and walked till
                    my arms
                    and legs ached. I thought how much they must ache in body and soul, looking for a home, food and
                    health.
                    Then, the comfort of Loreto [her former congregation] came to tempt me. "You have only to say the
                    word and
                    all that will be yours again", the Tempter kept on saying. ... Of free choice, my God, and out of
                    love for
                    you, I desire to remain and do whatever be your Holy will in my regard. I did not let a single tear
                    come.[42]

                    On 7 October 1950, Mother Teresa received Vatican permission for the diocesan congregation, which
                    would
                    become the Missionaries of Charity.[43] In her words, it would care for "the hungry, the naked, the
                    homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared
                    for
                    throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by
                    everyone".[44]

                    In 1952, Mother Teresa opened her first hospice with help from Calcutta officials. She converted an
                    abandoned Hindu temple into the Kalighat Home for the Dying, free for the poor, and renamed it
                    Kalighat, the
                    Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday).[45] Those brought to the home received medical attention and
                    the
                    opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with their faith: Muslims were read the Quran, Hindus
                    received
                    water from the Ganges, and Catholics received extreme unction.[46] "A beautiful death", Mother
                    Teresa said,
                    "is for people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted."[46]

                    She opened a hospice for those with leprosy, calling it Shanti Nagar (City of Peace).[47] The
                    Missionaries
                    of Charity established leprosy-outreach clinics throughout Calcutta, providing medication, dressings
                    and
                    food.[48] The Missionaries of Charity took in an increasing number of homeless children; in 1955,
                    Mother
                    Teresa opened Nirmala Shishu Bhavan, the Children's Home of the Immaculate Heart, as a haven for
                    orphans and
                    homeless youth.[49]

                    The congregation began to attract recruits and donations, and by the 1960s it had opened hospices,
                    orphanages and leper houses throughout India. Mother Teresa then expanded the congregation abroad,
                    opening a
                    house in Venezuela in 1965 with five sisters.[50] Houses followed in Italy (Rome), Tanzania and
                    Austria in
                    1968, and, during the 1970s, the congregation opened houses and foundations in the United States and
                    dozens
                    of countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.[51]

                    The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a contemplative branch of the Sisters
                    followed
                    in 1976. Lay Catholics and non-Catholics were enrolled in the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa, the Sick
                    and
                    Suffering Co-Workers, and the Lay Missionaries of Charity. Responding to requests by many priests,
                    in 1981,
                    Mother Teresa founded the Corpus Christi Movement for Priests[52] and with Joseph Langford founded
                    the
                    Missionaries of Charity Fathers in 1984 to combine the vocational aims of the Missionaries of
                    Charity with
                    the resources of the priesthood.[53]

                    By 1997, the 13-member Calcutta congregation had grown to more than 4,000 sisters who managed
                    orphanages,
                    AIDS hospices and charity centers worldwide, caring for refugees, the blind, disabled, aged,
                    alcoholics, the
                    poor and homeless and victims of floods, epidemics and famine.[54] By 2007, the Missionaries of
                    Charity
                    numbered about 450 brothers and 5,000 sisters worldwide, operating 600 missions, schools and
                    shelters in 120
                    countries.

                <h3>International charity</h3>
                <p align="justify">Mother Teresa said, "By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I
                    am a
                    Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong entirely to the
                    Heart of
                    Jesus."[4] Fluent in five languages – Bengali,[56] Albanian, Serbian, English and Hindi – she made
                    occasional trips outside India for humanitarian reasons.[57]

                    At the height of the Siege of Beirut in 1982, Mother Teresa rescued 37 children trapped in a
                    front-line
                    hospital by brokering a temporary cease-fire between the Israeli army and Palestinian
                    guerrillas.[58]
                    Accompanied by Red Cross workers, she travelled through the war zone to the hospital to evacuate the
                    young
                    patients.[59]

                    When Eastern Europe experienced increased openness in the late 1980s, Mother Teresa expanded her
                    efforts to
                    Communist countries which had rejected the Missionaries of Charity. She began dozens of projects,
                    undeterred
                    by criticism of her stands against abortion and divorce: "No matter who says what, you should accept
                    it with
                    a smile and do your own work." She visited Armenia after the 1988 earthquake[60] and met with Soviet
                    Premier
                    Nikolai Ryzhkov.[61]

                    Mother Teresa travelled to assist the hungry in Ethiopia, radiation victims at Chernobyl and
                    earthquake
                    victims in Armenia.[62][63][64] In 1991 she returned to Albania for the first time, opening a
                    Missionaries
                    of Charity Brothers home in Tirana.[65]

                    By 1996, the Missionaries of Charity operated 517 missions in over 100 countries.[66] The number of
                    sisters
                    in the Missionaries of Charity grew from twelve to thousands, serving the "poorest of the poor" in
                    450
                    centres worldwide. The first Missionaries of Charity home in the United States was established in
                    the South
                    Bronx area of New York City, and by 1984 the congregation operated 19 establishments throughout the
                    country

                <h3>Declining health and death</h3>
                <p align="justify">Mother Teresa had a heart attack in Rome in 1983 while she was visiting Pope John
                    Paul II.
                    Following a second attack in 1989, she received a pacemaker.[68] In 1991, after a bout of pneumonia
                    in
                    Mexico, she had additional heart problems. Although Mother Teresa offered to resign as head of the
                    Missionaries of Charity, in a secret ballot the sisters of the congregation voted for her to stay,
                    and she
                    agreed to continue.[69]

                    In April 1996, Mother Teresa fell, breaking her collarbone, and four months later she had malaria
                    and heart
                    failure. Although she underwent heart surgery, her health was clearly declining. According to
                    Archbishop of
                    Calcutta Henry Sebastian D'Souza, he ordered a priest to perform an exorcism (with her permission)
                    when she
                    was first hospitalised with cardiac problems because he thought she might be under attack by the
                    devil.[70]

                    On 13 March 1997, Mother Teresa resigned as head of the Missionaries of Charity. She died on 5
                    September.[71][72] At the time of her death, the Missionaries of Charity had over 4,000 sisters and
                    an
                    associated brotherhood of 300 members operating 610 missions in 123 countries.[73] These included
                    hospices
                    and homes for people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis, soup kitchens, children's and family
                    counselling programmes, orphanages and schools. The Missionaries of Charity were aided by co-workers
                    numbering over one million by the 1990s.[74]

                    Mother Teresa lay in repose in an open casket in St Thomas, Calcutta, for a week before her funeral.
                    She
                    received a state funeral from the Indian government in gratitude for her service to the poor of all
                    religions in the country.[75] Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano, the Pope's representative,
                    delivered the homily at the service.[76] Mother Teresa's death was mourned in the secular and
                    religious
                    communities. Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif called her "a rare and unique individual who
                    lived long
                    for higher purposes. Her life-long devotion to the care of the poor, the sick, and the disadvantaged
                    was one
                    of the highest examples of service to our humanity."[77] According to former U.N. Secretary-General
                    Javier
                    Pérez de Cuéllar, "She is the United Nations. She is peace in the world</p>

                <p align="justify">In 1950, Mother Teresa established the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic
                    religious
                    congregation. It began as a small community with 12 members in Kolkata, India. It then began to
                    attract
                    recruits and donations; and by the 1960s it had opened hospices, orphanages and leper houses
                    throughout
                    India. In 1965, Pope Paul VI approved Mother Teresa’s request to expand her congregation to other
                    countries.
                    Its first house was opened in Venezuela the same year. By 2012, the Missionaries of Charity had over
                    4,500
                    sisters and was active in 133 countries. It continues to care for those who include refugees, former
                    prostitutes, the mentally ill, sick children, abandoned children, lepers, people with AIDS, the aged
                    and
                    convalescent.</p>

                    in
                    Kalighat, Kolkata with help from Indian officials. She did so by seeking permission to use an old
                    abandoned
                    Hindu temple to the goddess Kali. Known as the Kalighat Home for the Dying, the hospice provided
                    medical
                    attention to those in need and it gave people the opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with
                    their
                    faith. In the words of Mother Teresa, it was “for people who lived</p>

                    of the Immaculate Heart. It was their first children’s home which cared for orphans. The center took
                    homeless children and provided them with food, shelter and medical care. When possible, the children
                    were
                    adopted out. Those not adopted were given an education, learned a trade skill and found marriages.

                    lead to
                    major disfiguration. Mother Teresa created a Leprosy Fund and a Leprosy Day to help educate the
                    public about
                    leprosy as many people feared the contagious disease. She also established several mobile leper
                    clinics to
                    provide the infected with medicine and bandages near their home. By the mid-1960s, Mother Teresa
                    opened a
                    place where lepers could live and work calling it Shanti Nagar (“The Place of Peace”).</p>

                    Nehru
                    Award for International Understanding in 1969. She received a number of other Indian awards. On
                    January 25,

                <p align="justify">Mother Teresa singled out abortion as "the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because
                    if a
                    mother can kill her own child – what is left for me to kill you and you kill me – there is nothing
                    between."[117]

                    Barbara Smoker of the secular humanist magazine The Freethinker criticised Mother Teresa after the
                    Peace
                    Prize award, saying that her promotion of Catholic moral teachings on abortion and contraception
                    diverted
                    funds from effective methods to solve India's problems.[118] At the Fourth World Conference on Women
                    in
                    Beijing, Mother Teresa said: "Yet we can destroy this gift of motherhood, especially by the evil of
                    abortion, but also by thinking that other things like jobs or positions are more important than

                <p align="justify">According to a paper by Canadian academics Serge Larivée, Geneviève Chénard and
                    Carole
                    Sénéchal, Mother Teresa's clinics received millions of dollars in donations but lacked medical care,
                    systematic diagnosis, necessary nutrition and sufficient analgesics for those in pain;[120] in the
                    opinion
                    of the three academics, "Mother Teresa believed the sick must suffer like Christ on the cross".[121]
                    It was
                    said that the additional money might have transformed the health of the city's poor by creating
                    advanced
                    palliative care facilities.[122][123]

                    One of Mother Teresa's most outspoken critics was English journalist and antitheist Christopher
                    Hitchens,
                    host of the documentary Hell's Angel (1994) and author of the essay The Missionary Position: Mother
                    Teresa
                    in Theory and Practice (1995) who wrote in a 2003 article: "This returns us to the medieval
                    corruption of
                    the church, which sold indulgences to the rich while preaching hellfire and continence to the poor.
                    [Mother
                    Teresa] was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a
                    gift from
                    God. She spent her life opposing the only known cure for poverty, which is the empowerment of women
                    and the
                    emancipation of them from a livestock version of compulsory reproduction."[124] He accused her of
                    hypocrisy
                    for choosing advanced treatment for her heart condition.[125][126] Hitchens said that "her intention
                    was not
                    to help people", and that she lied to donors about how their contributions were used. "It was by
                    talking to
                    her that I discovered, and she assured me, that she wasn't working to alleviate poverty", he said,
                    "She was
                    working to expand the number of Catholics. She said, 'I'm not a social worker. I don't do it for
                    this
                    reason. I do it for Christ. I do it for the church'".[127] Although Hitchens thought he was the only
                    witness
                    called by the Holy See, Aroup Chatterjee (author of Mother Teresa: The Untold Story) was also called
                    to
                    present evidence opposing Mother Teresa's beatification and canonisation.[128]

                    In 1994, Mother Teresa argued that the sexual abuse allegations against Jesuit priest Donald McGuire
                    were
                    untrue. When he was convicted of sexually molesting multiple children in 2006, Mother Teresa's
                    defense of
                    him was criticised.[129][130]

                    Abortion-rights groups have also criticised Mother Teresa's stance against abortion and
